# WeatherApp
I built this project to practice consuming external RESTful APIs and handling JSON data in a .NET environment.
WeatherApp web application built with ASP.NET Core. It allows users to quickly check the current weather conditions for any city worldwide by fetching real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Please don't forget to add the API key generated from OpenWeatherMap in appsettings.json for it to work.
